/**
 * This hook takes a target string and will return an annotated string that
 * allows downstream observers to infer what changes have been made to the
 * target string.
 *
 * It does this by adding a key element to each character that will persist
 * through character changes.
 *
 * For example, if the target was initially 'abc' and then suddenly became
 * 'axc', if we assume the hook initially supplied:
 *
 * (read *x i* as {char: 'x', key: i})
 *
 * [a 0, b 1, c 2]
 *
 * it might then supply:
 *
 * [a 0, x 1, c 2]
 *
 * indicating that the b had been replaced by the x, OR
 *
 * [a 0, *empty string* 1, x 3, c 2]
 *
 * indicating that the b was removed and the x was added. In either case, what
 * happened is quite explicit.
 *
 * @param target The string to follow
